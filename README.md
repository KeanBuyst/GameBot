# GameBot
A Discord game bot. With a custom engine built ontop of discords API using emoji's for pixels.
> [!WARNING]
> Deprecated
> 
> Was built 3 years ago on an older version of discord, before the introduction of the Discord SDK. So at the time there was no built-in game creation system for discord.
> Therefore there is no requirement for this type of engine anymore ( Sadly :cry: )
